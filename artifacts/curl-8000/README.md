### Bug-inducing commit information
- bug-inducing commit: [dd7521bcc1b7a6fcb53c31f9bd1192fcc884bd56](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dd7521bcc1b7a6fcb53c31f9bd1192fcc884bd56) (24 Apr 2018)
    - search the first commit that failure occurred by reproducing on the commit history with the fuzz target and the bug-revealing input
    - changed functions: `Curl_httpchunk_read(connectdata *, char *, ssize_t, ssize_t *)`, `strcpy_url(char *, const char *, bool)`
    - bug locations: [lib/transfer.c:1522](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dd7521bcc1b7a6fcb53c31f9bd1192fcc884bd56#diff-76e92705200fa8317ac3f635fd17d0ffe976a42e304edfd6c5ce024857a14ca0R1522) 
- [seed_corpus.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onSquIuVxm2GLWHjGRi2EDZehqTRNolI/view?usp=share_link): initial seed corpus at bug-inducing commit (4202 initial seeds in `seed_corpus/`)
	- \# seed corpus at failure-observed commit: 4202
	- \# seed corpus at fix-inducing commit: 4202
- the number of commits between failure-observed commit and BIC: 0
	- BIC is a commit right before failure-observed commit

### Bug-fixing commit information
- bug-fixing commit: [3c630f9b0af097663a64e5c875c580aa9808a92b](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c630f9b0af097663a64e5c875c580aa9808a92b) (25 Apr 2018)
    - search the commit that the expected failure by the bug-revealing input does not induce after oss-fuzz issue report time
    - developers explicitly mentioned the bug fixes [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/3c630f9b0af097663a64e5c875c580aa9808a92b)
    - changed functions: `strcpy_url(char *, const char *, bool)`
    - fix locations: [lib/transfer.c:1522](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/dd7521bcc1b7a6fcb53c31f9bd1192fcc884bd56#diff-76e92705200fa8317ac3f635fd17d0ffe976a42e304edfd6c5ce024857a14ca0R1522) 
- the number of commits between BIC and BFC: 1

### Failure samples
- failure by a target bug: 1 failure in `target_failures/`
    - a failure induced by a failure-reproducing input among attached inputs in oss-fuzz issues between BIC and BFC date, which appears from BIC until BFC
- failures by other bugs: 0 failures

- target failure symptom
    - type: heap-buffer-overflow  
    - failure stack trace patterns for the expected failure:  
		```
        strcpy_url /src/curl/lib/transfer.c:1540:9  
        concat_url /src/curl/lib/transfer.c:1707:3  
        Curl_follow /src/curl/lib/transfer.c:1771:22
		```

- `oracle.py` determines the detected failures by fuzzers are induced by the target bug or not. It receives a file which is the execution result of the fuzz target with a failing-input:  
	```
	./curl_fuzzer failing-input 2> exec_result
	python3 oracle.py exec_result
	```

### Experiment with 2 baseline fuzzers 
- fuzzers
    - libFuzzer of llvm 14.0.0
    - AFL++ 4.05c
- seed_corpus: 4202 seeds (seed_corpus.tar)
- time to first failure detection (limit 21600s)
